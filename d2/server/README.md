# Deadline 2 Server instructions

## Starting the Node Server

Type into your terminal
```
$ node app.js
```
and the server should start at port 3000 over the local network stack. If there is react running over the server that you need to test, make sure that react has been built with
```
$ npm run-script build
```

## Starting the Node.js Dev environment

Type into your terminal
```
npm run-script start
```
and this should boot up the development evironment over a port (your browser should open by default, the react dev server will choose an open port such as 3000 or 5000)
